 How to run
============

 1. compile the mex files by launching the script "make.m" (precompiled mex files are provided for windows, linux, and mac)

 2. run the script "example_color.m" or "example_hyperpsectral.m"

The script demo allows you to modify easily :
- the image you want to deal with
- the blur
- the reguarization parameters
